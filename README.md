**what is mMenu?**

mMenu is a weapon, vehicle spawner and a teleporting menu. It's also known as a PvP menu that can be used only in a red zone (This is optional).

**Please read:**

If you want players to access the menu in only red zones or any other coords. Go to line and do the following:

```
        dist = #(vector3(-227.3,-2622.93,6.05)-pos) <------------ change this to your own coords
        if dist <= 140 then <-------------- distance where the player will be able to open the menu

            inZone = true <------- change to false
        else
            inZone = false <------- change to true
        end

```
